# Dynamic Poetry Analyzer Lab Solution

A dynamic solution to a lab assignment analyzing poetry, showcasing my expertise in programming concepts like dynamic memory allocation and makefile usage.

Welcome to my Dynamic Poetry Analyzer repository! üìùüíª

## Key Highlights:

- **Innovative Approach:** This project exemplifies a creative and efficient solution that demands proficiency in concepts such as binary files, dynamic memory allocation, makefile usage, and version control with GitLab.

- **Complete Lab Solution:** The repository contains a meticulously crafted program named `all_poem.c`, designed to fulfill the requirements of the lab assignment. It accurately analyzes poems provided in text files, calculating the total number of words and lines, as well as the word count per line.

- **Dynamic Memory Management:** My solution leverages dynamic memory allocation, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability. I employ `realloc` to dynamically resize arrays, accommodating varying input sizes without compromising performance.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** The codebase is accompanied by detailed comments and a comprehensive README file, providing clear instructions on usage, program structure, constraints, and submission guidelines. Employers can easily understand the rationale behind design decisions and implementation strategies.

- **Robust Testing:** The program undergoes rigorous testing to ensure functionality, correctness, and adherence to specifications. I guarantee clean compilation with no errors or warnings using `-Wall` and `-std=c99` flags in `gcc`, facilitating seamless integration into any development environment.

- **Professional Workflow:** The repository follows best practices in software development, including the use of a makefile for compilation, adherence to coding standards, and version control with GitLab. The submission process is streamlined, enabling efficient collaboration and evaluation.

By exploring this repository, employers gain valuable insights into my technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, and commitment to excellence. I invite you to delve into the codebase, witness the ingenuity of my solution, and envision the potential contributions I can make to your organization.
